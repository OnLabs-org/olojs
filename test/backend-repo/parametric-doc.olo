# Parametric document
The URL ends with a query string that looks like `?x=xval&y=yval&z=zval`. The
query parameters are available in this document context:

* The value of `x` is `<% x %>`
* The value of `y` is `<% y %>`
* The value of `z` is `<% z %>`

If you now change the query string in the URL, the values in the list above
should change accordingly.
